## Assigment 1
Assess the three proposed scenarios. In each case you should estimate the resulting increase in profitability, and try to explain the reason for differences between these three figures.
    Scenario 1 - daily rate by 10%
        Increasing the daily rate by 10% has an effect on the Gross profit of 89.09% and the OTA Cost which is calculated based on the daily rate, which impacts the operating cost and results in a noticeable increase in sales and profits but may cause a decrease in the number of customers.
        These scenario has the most profitability due to the direct processing which doesn't rely on other channels.
    Scenario 2 - OTA channels by 10%
        Increasing the number of bookings coming through OTA channels by 10% causes a slight increase in sales but an equal increase in OTA Costs similar to scenario 1, leading to an increase in operating cost but no equivalent increase in sales.
        This scenario has an increase in profitability but with corresponding increase in cost, the profits are diminished
    Scenario 3 - brand.com website by 10%
        Increasing the number of bookings coming through the brand.com website by 10% leads to no increase in OTA Cost but an increase in operating cost due to an increase in the cost of sales, a slight increase in Net profitand sales lowest of all scenarios
        This scenario has a slight increase in cost lower than scenario 2 but with an increase in cost similar to it which makes it the least profitable scenario 



How could you make the three different alternative scenarios more realistic?
Scenario 1
Increasing awareness through direct channels 
Scenario 2
Paying the OTA to do more publicity 
Scenario 3
Advertising website more on social media and other plateforms

## Assigment 2
Your general manager has heard that ecommerce giant (let’s pretend Amazon.com) is about to enter the online hotel distribution game. As he knows little about distribution issues, he has asked you to assess the positives and negatives of adding this new channel to your existing extensive portfolio of electronic distribution channels once the service comes to your city.

Taking into account what you learned in this module:

#### (1) Make (and justify) a recommendation on whether you think it would be beneficial for a hotel to distribute itself through Amazon’s new service?

It will be beneficial for the hotel to distribute itself through the Amazon's new service. 
This service provides the hotel with access to new markets and visibility through its communication channels and target audience, thus expanding its distrubution and customers, this is translated by new customers and an increase in sales. 
The new service come with affordable commisions to attract new customers, so as to build its customer base and gain reputation.
The new service comes with innovative marketing and distrubutions strategies to reach out to new customers or people in search for novelty.

#### (2) Highlight and explain to an unknowledgeable reader three major advantages of adding Amazon as a distribution partner.

Popularity
The property benefits from the popularity of the new service, which gives them a great boost in visibility and exposure. This leads to more bookings and new guests from different parts of the world.

New Markets
The new service comes with a target new market in which it hopes to proliferate and an increased visibility on distrubution channels. 

Innovation
The new service comes with innovative marketing strategies which could optimize the current systems in place. A new team of strategist and marketers with expertise in marketing and communication.


#### (3) Highlight and explain to an unknowledgeable reader three challenges with using Amazon as a distribution partner.

Revenue loss
Anytime a guest reserves a stay through an OTA, the hotel must pay a commission to the OTA, which can range anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of a booking. Much like a finder’s fee, the act of paying commission in return for booking guests is a long-standing business model. But because OTA usage is becoming so prevalent, it’s increasingly difficult for hotels to compete for bookings on their own sites, meaning commission payments are increasing for many properties at the expense of hotel website visits.

Loss of Communication Control
Along with loss over the revenue the manufacturer also loses control over what message is being conveyed to the final customers. The reseller may engage in personal selling in order to increase the product sale and communicate about the product to his customers. He might exaggerate about the benefits of the product this may lead to miscommunication problems with end users. The marketer may provide training to the salespersons of retail outlets but on the whole he has no control on the final message conveyed.

Lack of Experience
As a new service, they may lack real life experience and reputation of old services. It may take sometime  to build a customer base, gain popularity, inspire confidence and become a reference point to travellers.
