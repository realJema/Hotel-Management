## Assigment 1
Assess the three proposed scenarios. In each case you should estimate the resulting increase in profitability, and try to explain the reason for differences between these three figures.
    Scenario 1 - daily rate by 10%
        Increasing the daily rate by 10% has an effect on the Gross profit of 89.09% and the OTA Cost which is calculated based on the daily rate, which impacts the operating cost and results in a noticeable increase in sales and profits but may cause a decrease in the number of customers.
        These scenario has the most profitability due to the direct processing which doesn't rely on other channels.
    Scenario 2 - OTA channels by 10%
        Increasing the number of bookings coming through OTA channels by 10% causes a slight increase in sales but an equal increase in OTA Costs similar to scenario 1, leading to an increase in operating cost but no equivalent increase in sales.
        This scenario has an increase in profitability but with corresponding increase in cost, the profits are diminished
    Scenario 3 - brand.com website by 10%
        Increasing the number of bookings coming through the brand.com website by 10% leads to no increase in OTA Cost but an increase in operating cost due to an increase in the cost of sales, a slight increase in Net profitand sales lowest of all scenarios
        This scenario has a slight increase in cost lower than scenario 2 but with an increase in cost similar to it which makes it the least profitable scenario 



How could you make the three different alternative scenarios more realistic?
Scenario 1
Increasing awareness through direct channels 
Scenario 2
Paying the OTA to do more publicity 
Scenario 3
Advertising website more on social media and other plateforms


Recommend which scenario your GM should focus on to better satisfy the owner? Explain your reasoning.
Scenario 1
This scenario provides the greatest profitability for the manager.

## Assigment 2
Your general manager has heard that ecommerce giant (let’s pretend Amazon.com) is about to enter the online hotel distribution game. As he knows little about distribution issues, he has asked you to assess the positives and negatives of adding this new channel to your existing extensive portfolio of electronic distribution channels once the service comes to your city.

Taking into account what you learned in this module:

##### (1) Make (and justify) a recommendation on whether you think it would be beneficial for a hotel to distribute itself through Amazon’s new service?

It will be beneficial for the hotel to distribute itself through the Amazon's new service. 
This service provides the hotel with access to new markets and visibility through its communication channels and target audience, thus expanding its distrubution and customers, this is translated by new customers and an increase in sales. 
The new service come with affordable commisions to attract new customers, so as to build its customer base and gain reputation.
The new service comes with innovative marketing and distrubutions strategies to reach out to new customers or people in search for novelty.

##### (2) Highlight and explain to an unknowledgeable reader three major advantages of adding Amazon as a distribution partner.

Popularity
The property benefits from the popularity of the new service, which gives them a great boost in visibility and exposure. This leads to more bookings and new guests from different parts of the world.

New Markets
The new service comes with a target new market in which it hopes to proliferate and an increased visibility on distrubution channels. 

Innovation
The new service comes with innovative marketing strategies which could optimize the current systems in place. A new team of strategist and marketers with expertise in marketing and communication.


##### (3) Highlight and explain to an unknowledgeable reader three challenges with using Amazon as a distribution partner.

Revenue loss
Anytime a guest reserves a stay through an OTA, the hotel must pay a commission to the OTA, which can range anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of a booking. Much like a finder’s fee, the act of paying commission in return for booking guests is a long-standing business model. But because OTA usage is becoming so prevalent, it’s increasingly difficult for hotels to compete for bookings on their own sites, meaning commission payments are increasing for many properties at the expense of hotel website visits.

Loss of Communication Control
Along with loss over the revenue the manufacturer also loses control over what message is being conveyed to the final customers. The reseller may engage in personal selling in order to increase the product sale and communicate about the product to his customers. He might exaggerate about the benefits of the product this may lead to miscommunication problems with end users. The marketer may provide training to the salespersons of retail outlets but on the whole he has no control on the final message conveyed.

Lack of Experience
As a new service, they may lack real life experience and reputation of old services. It may take sometime  to build a customer base, gain popularity, inspire confidence and become a reference point to travellers.

## Assignment 3
##### Define your customers from the information given and suggest which market/channel segments you will target for sales of the new Executive experience. Give justifications for your decision.
Customers
With Media and Fashion Companies in the neighborhood the potential clients are;
Journalists
Models
Actors
Corporate travellers
tourists
etc...

Target Market Segment    
I suggest the hotel goes for a Corporate/Negotiated segment with deals agreed between the hotel and the company or the agencies for a certain period of time and can only be booked by guests who qualify for that rate. Which could be 10+ rooms or strict cacellation rules.

Justification
Businesses in the media and fashion world are seasonal, with clients coming in waves and groups. The agency/people in charge of the lodging usually make arrangements before hand for their stay. With such attractions nearby the most profitable customers will come in groups thus a corporate pricing is the most profitable for the hotel.

##### Please suggest how you will differentiate the customer experience and explain how this is relevant and attractive to the identified guest segment.
1. Create and promote special packages.
Packaging allows you to mask actual room rates with features, which add value to staying in the hotel. If the hotel offers additional services like fitness classes and spa treatments, package them together with accommodation for a specific category of customers, for example premium customers. This will be a great deal that encourages guests to book under specific conditions.
2. Discounts on amenities.
By Offering discounts on the amenities of the hotel, such as on the bar and the buffet service, free drinks or desserts, for premium guests or clients who book under specific packages only, the hotel will encourage clients to book in group or choose those specific packages.
With discounted amenities, this will encourage clients to book under the corporate market segment more easily in order for them to benefit from those services.

3. Seasonal Promotions
Updating their offers according to events and special occasions happening in the local community and offering special offers which target these specific market segments.

4. Event-based promotions
It’s likely your destination will be involved in a number of large events throughout the year. It makes a lot of sense to capitalise on these and include them in your promotions. People will already be researching these events so if your hotel has a deal on in conjunction with them, awareness of your hotel should increase along with site traffic.

5. Partnership promotions
The hotel is situated in a thriving location where they are not the only business looking to capitalise on the many travellers to the area. Combining with other businesses will reduce the cost of promotion and marketing, and give you wider coverage as long as your partner holds up their end of the bargain. It may also give you access to a new market and create ongoing business. Creating partnership with the media and fashion companies.

##### With a focus on offering that “bit extra” the guest is looking for, explain how you will integrate this into two targeted marketing campaigns.
1st Campaign
The first campaign should Showcase the newly refurbished rooms and the amenities of the hotel in order to attract potential customers from every market segment.

2nd Campaign
The Second campaign shoudl introduce special packages which offer discounts on amenities and diverse other benefits for guest who book under the corporate segment with negotiated rates such as 10+ bookings or 10+ rooms.


## Assignment 4 
You are currently working as the front­-of­-house manager at a medium sized independent hotel.  Looking at your revenue forecasts you notice that you have a very quiet weekend coming up five weeks from now.  You decide to create a special offer –  a package giving exceptional value to the customer if they stay during the weekend in question.

With a brand new website, you are relatively sure that you will be able to sell this package if you can successfully position it in front of the right customer.  You see three possible techniques that you could use:

(1) Paid Search Engine Marketing 

(2) Email marketing

(3) Selling through daily deal affiliates such as GroupOn

Having watched this module and read the complementary readings, critically evaluate each option as a method of driving additional business in the short term.

##### Critically evaluate Paid Search Engine Marketing as a marketing technique to help sell your packages within the next few weeks. Outline and explain three advantages and three limitations of using this technique in this highly specific situation.

Paid Search and Search Engine Optimization Occurs through a search engine such as Google, and takes place on what is essentially an auction market. The hotel bids on the Pay-Per-Click (PPC) cost which it is willing to incur for the specific key words consumers use to conduct a web search. Google has made available specific SEM opportunities for hotels with its Hotel Ads program. The financial benefits of paid search are significant. According to a study (conducted by Prognosis Digital, a hospitality-focused digital marketing firm based in India), global hotel brands with the objective of increasing the number of online bookings and targeting international tourists and business travelers invested in a PPC campaign and saw results within 10 months. The PPC campaign increased web traffic, increased conversion rates, and counteracted tough competition from local players who had established strong presence for related key words. On average, these hotels increased the number of bookings by over 300 bookings per hotel, and decreased the cost per click incurred by 250%.

Advantages
Paid search is effective, results are immediately visible, and efforts are easily measured. Paid search extends to banner space on other websites including online travel agency (OTA) websites. It can be shut on and off whenever deemed necessary. 

Hotels now have the ability to utilize Search Engine Marketing (SEM) strategies- to position and differentiate their products and services in a continuously expanding online marketplace.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which is completely organic, and essentially free. Hotels and brands do not pay fees to Google or any other search engine. The only fee is to the agency, which manages SEO activity. SEO is also advantageous because as optimization causes online presence to be more profound, the hotel does not need to invest as much of its marketing budget into paid search

Disadvantages
The Cost-Per-Click (CPC) can be as expensive as $6 per-click if not more – costs which quickly accumulate particularly for smaller, independent hotels. Bidding for large numbers and varying combinations of words can bring the average CPC down to manageable levels, however, hotels using solely paid search are incurring unnecessarily high online marketing costs.

Other aspects of paid search to be wary of include prospective guests’ emotive responses to the word ‘sponsored’. Guests seeking to book hotels online could be skeptic and less trusting of the advertisements paid for by hotels and other businesses.

SEO requires continuous changes to source code in the hotel website, and linking it with others websites. The challenge inherent in SEO is that’s its efforts may take quite a while – perhaps as long as six to nine months – before resulting in significant online presence.

##### Critically evaluate Email Marketing as a marketing technique to help sell your packages within the next few weeks. Outline and explain three advantages and three limitations of using this technique in this highly specific situation.
Email Marketing is when a user sign's up our agrees to receive weekly updates, information, special offers about the hotel property by sharing his email informations on one of the communication channels of the hotel (website, OTA). 

Advantages
It’s Quick and Easy. 
With the various tools and platforms available, creating professional email marketing communications has never been more simple. Plan carefully and craft a finely-tuned message or blast out a deal-of-the-day that gets immediate results.

Stay Top of Mind
One of the basic purposes of email marketing is to maintain regular communication with past, potential, and current customers. This helps to reinforce the positive feelings they have about your organization, and ensures that they will remember your business even when they are most distracted. During the rush of the holidays you can make sure that your customers think of you first to spend their dollars with your company. In the slow season for your industry it can provide a boost to sales and make sure people do not forget about all you have to offer.

Personalize Your Messaging
The benefits of personalizing your marketing messages are too great to ignore. Email marketing campaigns allow you to address your customers by name, speak directly to them, and show the human side of your company and team. With email, you can present the personality of your business and better resonate with your audience.


Disadvantages

Spam
commercial email or 'spam' irritates consumers. If your messages aren’t targeted to the right people, the recipient may delete your email or unsubscribe. You need to make sure that your email marketing complies with privacy and data protection rules, and that it is properly targeted at people who want to receive it. The 'click through rate' for untargeted emails is likely to be very low.

Undelivered emails
poorly designed emails may not get delivered. Emails that use certain spam keywords in the subject heading or content of the email are likely to be filtered out by email software and internet service providers. If you don’t keep your marketing lists up to date, you will find incorrect email addresses mean your messages won’t reach the right person.

Design problems
Your email must be designed so that it appears as it should across multiple devices and email providers.  You may encounter a trade-off between design and functionality. Some people opt to receive text-only emails, consider how your message will look if this is the case.  
##### Critically evaluate daily deal affiliates such as GroupOn as a marketing technique to help sell your packages within the next few weeks. Outline and explain three advantages and three limitations of using this technique in this highly specific situation.

Affiliate marketing is a joint and mutually beneficial business partnership between merchants and website publishers/owners whereby an affiliate is compensated for every visitor or client provided through his effort. The moment a customer makes a purchase of goods or service, part of the profit generated from that particular transaction is credited to the affiliate's account as a commission. Amounts of compensation may be based on a fixed value for each visit (pay-per-click), registration (pay-per-lead), or for every purchaser (pay-per-sale).


Advantages
The affiliate does not have to worry about customer support, book keeping, and e-commerce related headaches since in affiliate marketing, the merchant handles it all; all the affiliate needs to do is promote and resell the product.

Low Startup Costs - setting up commerce delivery online can require a lot of start-up investment. The affiliate need not invest anything other than some time. If one area doesn't work out, the affiliate can quickly move onto another area. The merchant has to too many sunk costs to do likewise.

Easy To Set-Up - You simply need to select a program, sign-up, add the tracking code to your site, and you're good to go.

Disadvantages

Pay On Performance - This is a great option for the merchant. They only pay when they sell something. What this does is transfer all the advertising risk to you. You may spend weeks or months on SEO and make no sales. This might not even be your fault. You get great rankings and traffic, but the merchant has an uncompetitive offer, or loses customers at the point of sale.

Limited Growth Potential - Because you can't lock in your customers or adapt deals to suit changing market conditions, growth potential is limited. Like the carpet salesman, you rely on a new stream of visitors each and every day with no way to grow what you do, other than by adding sub-affiliates.

High Competition - One of the pros of affiliate marketing is that is is easy to sign up and get started. This is also a negative. If it is easy for you to sign up, then it is easy for everyone to do likewise. There are new affiliate hordes arriving each and every day. The incentive for the merchant and affiliate network is to sign on as many performing affiliates as they can, so they don't really care if you face ever increasing levels of competition.

## Assignment 5
##### Based on what you have learned in this module, what do you think should be the hotel's three priorities in order to generate additional business from its OTA partner? 

Targeted Ad Campaigns
There are thousands of hotels listed in OTAs that means there is a high competition between them to rank higher in search results. To increase the visibility of your hotel you can opt for ads or pay-per-click campaigns to optimize the profile. It is helpful for small and mid-sized hotels to get more exposure. When the rank of your hotel is low, these ads assist you in listing higher as compared to the organic listing.

Accurate Room Availability And Rates
One more crucial factor in maintaining a good hotel profile on OTA is shared the room availability and rates in real time. When the OTA profile is regularly updated this usually boosts the occupancy rate. Through a channel manager, you can update the necessary details automatically over several OTAs and that too simultaneously. Therefore, keeping the room information will help you avoid overbooking. On the contrary, with an accurate hotel profile, you will enjoy higher rank and conversion.

Connect With The Market Managers
You can ask OTAs to get yourself in contact with their marketing managers. They are highly trained individuals who have extensive knowledge of the hotel marketing. They will help you in understanding the trends that are being followed in your location, what packages will attract tourist towards your hotel, guide you to the targeted ads etc. By working with the market managers small and mid-sized hotels will get a substantial advantage of their experience.

 
## Assignment 6
Forecasting is an important part of the Revenue Management process. This exercise will familiarize you with two different forecasting models and help you understand why a Revenue Manager’s experience and knowledge is also key.

The Plaza hotel is an independent city centre property with 122 rooms. The past month performance has been quieter than expected and the hotel is now moving into a key business period.

There are several events happening over this period which will drive demand in the area, some repeating from last year and some new.

The General Manager has asked you to complete a forecast for the next calendar month, to identify any periods of low or high demand to ensure all revenue opportunities are maximized.

The hotel works with 5 market segments:

· Corporate Individual

· Groups

· Transient Non Negotiated

· Transient FIT

· Other

Using one or both of the two forecasting methods in the Revenue Management module:

Create a one month forecast for your hotel, by market segment.
Identify two periods with forecasted occupancy of 100% + and recommend which inventory controls you would put in place to maximize occupancy. Review this by market segment if necessary.
Identify two periods of forecasted occupancy of below 65% and give recommendations of which segment to target with value added promotions.

##### Create a forecast for one month by market segment using the # pace model, % pace model or a combination of both. You should review figures and manually override the forecast where necessary. Give justifications for your final figures

##### From your completed forecast, identify two periods when demand is forecasted to be over 100%. What inventory restrictions would you recommend putting in place to maximize these opportunities? Be specific by market segment as necessary. 

##### From your completed forecast, identify two periods when low occupancy is expected. Which market segments would you recommend to target over these periods and why?
