# Hotel Management

## Week 1
owning and operating, franchising and management service agreements

### Hotel Value Chain
The value adding activities and their key players. All activities performed to;
1.  ***Owners*** 
Ownership of the property. This group is diverse and includes private equity funds, reads, private wealthy investors, hotel groups and other types of investors. This activity generally involves some kind of asset and financial management tasks.
2. ***Operators***
the daily running of hotel operations, the day-to-day servicing of guests as well as the upkeep of the property
3. ***Distributors***
distribution includes sales and marketing activities. The tasks involved here all aim at bringing heads in the beds, as is commonly said. The emergence of companies in the distribution space driven by digital revolution has significantly affected the relationship between all of the players within the value chain. Their emergence has been key to the current environment of the hospitality industry. 
4. ***Brands***
Include brand names. These activities include branding related tasks as well as customer and relationship management  

### Franchise Agreement
It is a legal contract in which a well established business consents to provide it's brand, operational model and required support to another party for them to set up and run a similar business In exchange for a fee and some share of the income generated. The franchise agreement lays out the details of what duties each of the party needs to perform in what compensation they can expect.  A typical franchise system offers value to its franchisees by offering the following services. 
- Marketing and advertising. 
- Brand recognition. 
- Reservation systems. 
- Cross-selling within the network. 
- Proven mode of operations, 
- technology, soft and hardware, 
- training, 
- design plans and specifications,
- financing, 
- site selection and market analysis, 
- PR and promotions, 
- quality assurance programs, and 
- purchasing benefits.  

The reason for choosing franchising and management contracts as development modes for branded hotel chains is primarily to speed up growth. Indeed developing through franchises management agreements requires little to no capital investments. Which enables firms to access new markets quickly, and with little risk. 

### Unit level Analysis 
Hotels as economic units. At the unit level, hotels compete for `market share` within a destination. In most cases, travelers select 
1. a destination that they want to visit, to experience, or where they have business to do.
2. compare alternative lodging products according to various criteria such as 
- location, 
- price, 
- features and services or lifestyle.

Hotels aim at capturing the biggest market share in the market in which they compete. 
##### Calculations
In practice, these metrics are often calculated on the basis of the weighted average performance of other hotels within what is called the competitive set or comp set. The metrics most widely used include 
- occupancy rate, 
- average daily rate, and 
- revenue per available room of RevPAR. 
1. Occupancy rate, 
 *number of rooms occupied / the number of rooms available*

2. Market Penetration Index(MPI)
 *(actual occupancy / theoretical occupancy rate) * 100.*

3. Occupancy 
*demand / supply* or
*number of rooms sold / number of rooms available.* 
4. Average daily rate(ADR)
*room revenue / number of rooms sold.* 
5. RevPAR 
room revenue/ number of rooms available or 
occupancy rate * average daily rate. 
6. Index numbers 
can be calculated for each of these three metrics, occupancy, ADR and RevPAR. 
(subject property value, occupancy, ADR or RevPAR, / comp set value) * 100

Hotels with index numbers above 100 are thus considered as **outperforming** their competitors. The index for occupancy is called the **Market penetration index**(MPI). It is called the 
- average rate index(ARI), for the average daily rate and 
- revenue generation index(RGI), for RevPAR.

> hotel rooms are perishable

### Revenue Management
Operating leverage
Financial leverage

**The demand** for hotel rooms is elastic, customers tend to be price sensitive. Thus when hoteliers increase the ADR, the demand as measured by occupancy tends to decrease. Revenue management is the art and science of trying to maximize RevPAR despite the elasticity of the demand

**The profit** of the hotel is thus only equal to the revenue minus the total costs for this level of quantity sold.

**The digital** evolution makes the entire ecosystem in which hotel rooms are searched, compared, evaluated, experienced, and reviewed much more complex. In this new environment successful companies and individuals will need to grasp the fundamentals of distribution, revenue, and demand management.

## Week 2

>You can have the best product in the world, the most comfortable beds, the most innovative restaurants, the most customer-friendly staff. But if no one can find you, no one can book you, then you will quickly go out of business.

The 3 P's
1. Price
2. Promotion
3. Place

**Distrubution** getting the right information to the right persons at the right time, to get them interested in your product as well as providing them with  a mechanism to complete the purchase and pay.

### Online Travel Agents(OTAs)

Underlying companies that position themselves between the consumer and the supplier, adding value by consolidating inventory and price, thus allowing customers to see the product offering of multiple brands without having to search successive sites. 

Central Reservation System(CRS), but for most hotels today, `the major OTA's are their prime source of online bookings`. Thus, an understanding of who these companies are and how they operate is essential to managing your online distribution

Best OTA's

1. Booking.com
2. Expedia Group
3. Priceline Group
4. MakeMyTrip
5. Agoda.com
6. TripAdvisor:
7. Hotels.com

## Week 3
**The hotel official web presence**
Multiple sites, each focusing on a specific market segment or geographical region controlled by and operated by the hotel with the objective of facilitating direct booking.

Cycle:
1. Deciding what your website actually does. Clarity, in terms of what you're trying to achieve f
rom the very beginning is absolutely essential. 
2. Register an appropriate step of domain names to facilitate consumer access to the website and to help them understand its purpose
3. Decide on the content that will be included on the site's pages, the functionality to be included. Having the right content is absolutely essential to both help the website to be found and to convince consumers to buy.
4. Driving business to your website is probably the step, `where you will spend most of your time, and most of your budget`. Unfortunately, unless you spend considerable time and money marketing your site, no one is likely to even know that it exist.  
- search engine optimization, 
- paid search engine marketing, 
- email marketing through your loyalty program, and 
- many other forms of electronic promotion.

#### Content
**Content drives search** Content drives conversion. Content earns engagement, if you have the right content on your web site, they will get found on search. Similarly, if you have the right content in your website, people will buy. And if you don't, they won't. And lastly, if you have the right content, particularly on social media channels, potential customers will engage with you and become brand evangelists. But if you don't, they won't. It's that simple. At the end of the day, it's all about content. You must `tailor your content appropriately`. So if you want to be found by these different market segments and you want to engage with them, and you want to sell to them, you need to have very different, carefully focused content. Matching the content to the target customer to your target audience is the key success factor. 

What do hotel customers want to do? 
Absolutely key is the `bookings engine`, which needs to be clear, fast, and absolutely transparently simple to use.
The site tries to upsell, as well as stressing the price parity
What else is important? 
as we move from budget, to mid-scale, to luxury and upscale properties, images and particularly multiple, high quality images, or even in some cases video, become much more important at convincing the customer to buy.


- The quality of the bookings engine, 
- multiple high quality images, and 
- user reviews 
are just three examples of the type of content that you need to consider including on your web pages. The key issue is to put the customers needs first, including only the content that they want on your pages. 

> your website is the first impression that many people will have of your business. 

it's essential these days that the resulting site is `mobile friendly`. Not only are more and more customers accessing sites through mobile devices, but search engines such as Google are giving higher emphasis to mobile friendly sites the phrase mobile first or mobile only has never been more important when it comes to website development.

The more significant challenge is `attracting and re-attracting visitors to your site`, so you can sell to them. In general the more traffic that you can manage to attract, and the longer you can keep these visitors on your site, the more opportunities you have to sell your product. Depending, of course, on the **quality of your content** as we discussed earlier.

1. Direct navigation
one of the most common ways that users will find your site is by directly typing your domain name, or what they think your domain name is, or what your domain name should be, into your web browser. 
2. Search engine marketing
both SEO and paid search engine marketing, display advertising, and even email marketing, all focus on reaching out to the customer and making them aware of your hotel and its services.
3. Traditional media
To reinforce direct bookings, the website's address should be incorporated onto everything, business cards, brochures, letterheads, anywhere you could possibly list your address.

#### Search engine marketing
The first step in trying to maximize traffic from the search engines, is to `register your site with the ones` on which you want to be listed.

Although Google is a dominant player, there are several other search engines out there aimed at particular geographical or special interest markets. So `hotels need to take the time to investigate, which search engines are actually being used by their target customers`. Once the engine has been alerted to your existence.

Break your content down into smaller, more compact and more specialized pages. Most search engines now advise that you should use the `relative keywords frequently`, but not obsessively. Focus on providing excellent content. With the `words that the user cares about featured prominently`. With the result that the pages will naturally rise to the top of the pile

**Conversion rate** is a key metric, and refers to the percentage of your website visitors who actually buy. Conversion rate is also relevant when using email marketing as a way of driving business. Many hotels use this technique to stay in contact with and try to sell to their customers. These take many forms, from e-mails promising special offers, to electronic newsletters highlighting new developments in the company.

#### Display Advertising
Banners, poster, flyers
Focus on the three elements
- increasing click through rate, 
- increasing the conversion of visitors once buyers come to your website, - decreasing the CPM.

depend largely on making either the advert or the offer more attractive to the web surfer

#### Affiliate Marketing
publishing links on other websites

#### Social Media Marketing
maintaining a social media community

#### Analytics 
Analytics can also help you establish the effectiveness of your online marketing techniques, helping you `understand which actions are driving business to your website`, what their respective conversion rate is, and helping you to establish what you.
Google Analytics can also give you information about: 
-how many people are accessing your site from a desktop or a mobile device, and 
- highlighting difference in performance between these devices
- see the typical paths that people take through your website
- What pages they look at, in what order, 
- how many people drop off from each screen, and 
- where they ultimately end up before they leave. 
This, and practically all of the other analysis shown, can be sliced and diced in many different ways to gain deep insights into how people are interacting with your site, and what parts are actually working. Perhaps the most interesting part, though, is how it can help you measure the success of your online marketing efforts.

## Week 4
Hotels need to be careful about getting overly dependent on the OTAs, particularly a single OTA as their primary source of business. Finding the happy balance between OTA spend and direct marketing spend is the key to optimizing bookings across all channels so as to maximize RevPar and profitability.

OTA's allow consumers to book airline, hotel, car rental, and other `travel services from a single, online source, by being listed on the OTA Hotels can get themselves into these consideration sets. Positioning themselves in front of customers that will be difficult or impossible for them to access otherwise. And thus potentially generating even more bookings. Thus we can see that **working with an OTA should end up with a hotel getting more exposure.**

#### The Billboard Effect
Working with OTAs 
- increases exposure
- increased number of indirect bookings 
- grow direct bookings a phenomenon that has become coined the billboard effect. 
To profit from this phenomenon, it is really important for hotels to have a really `appealing website` packed with relevant content and with a modern, easy to use and intuitive bookings engine. In particular, room rates need to be displayed very prominently and clearly. 

Research has shown that while consumers initially search on OTA websites, once they find something they like, they also search for and look at pricing and availability on the supplier's brand dot com website.
Be sure to `sign them up for your loyalty program` so that you can keep in contact with them afterwards, and let them know about future offers. In other words, use the OTAs as a cost effective way of finding new guests. But then use the promise of `enhanced value to create a direct customer for life`. The golden rule is to **communicate**. Let the guests know what they have gained by booking directly or lost by booking through the OTA. 

#### Reactivity
Another benefit that working with OTAs brings is the ability to `react quickly to changes in market conditions and booking patterns`. OTAs have the potential to rapidly drive additional business in situations where the hotel needs it. 
#### Market Information
With their global vision of what's happening, OTAs are well-placed to understand overall booking patterns, including supply and demand, for your particular market. As such, they can provide the hotel with macro-level intelligence as well as `deep-market insights` that will be difficult to obtain otherwise. 

### Key Success Factors 
#### Photos
Having multiple high quality and dramatic photos. **Showcasing** all aspects of your hotel property.
Investing in outstanding photographical content is a must and is something that will be repaid multiple times over, `good photos drive an emotional response` that can be the difference between winning the booking or losing the sale.
#### Content
Ensuring that all `hotel features and amenities are included on the OTA listing`. Customers often search on OTA websites, specifying specific amenities that they want, and not including these items on your listing means you will not be displayed and thus lose potential business.
If some aspect of your **location**, such as your proximity to some landmark or business or alternatively even your lack of proximity or remoteness, is important and makes you different or attractive, make sure to stress it in your OTA description. Hotels also need to pay a lot of attention to their `textual descriptions`, both for the property as a whole and for each and every room type and rate offered.
#### User Reviews
First of all, they should ensure that the `product and service provided matches customer expectations` to avoid disappointment and frustration.
Deal with any `customer service` issues before the customer checks out, in order to ensure that departing guests are happy and thus, likely to leave positive feedback.
Travelers are willing to pay more for a hotel with higher review scores.
#### Competitive Rates
Most OTAs maintain sophisticated rate comparison software, constantly scanning the hotel's prices on both direct and indirect channels to ensure that they have access to at least the best available rates. And they feed this information into their ranking algorithm.
When figures start to look busy, manipulate things using room `rates rather than availability`. Remember that OTAs typically earn a percentage of your room rates, so putting your prices up means they will potentially earn a fixed percentage of a higher figure, and thus it maybe even help you in your placement, as it now becomes even more interesting for them to sell you rather than one of your competitors.

# Week 1

A comprehensive understanding of `segmentation, Forecasting and budgeting, and Pricing` an essential requirement for today's hospitality professionals.

**Cost of acquisition** 
while trying to determine what to charge a customer.
**Rate parity** 
means maintaining consistent rates for the same product on all distribution channels.

#### Revenue management
Refers to a business practice designed to `optimize the revenue potential of an asset`, namely a hotel, through a variety of market conditions. Four major conditions must exist for it to apply: 
- A fixed amount of supply is available.
- Inventory or supply is perishable.
- Different customers are willing to pay different price for the same supply. 
- And there is some ability to predict future demand for supply.

#### A right PPTC
The primary aim of revenue management is selling the ***right product*** to the ***right customer*** at the ***right price*** for the ***right time***, and with the ***right pack***. It's about understanding the relationship between supply and demand and price elasticity. There are three major areas to focus on when getting started with revenue management within a hotel. 
1. Segmentation, 
2. forecasting and budgeting, and 
3. pricing.

### 1. Segmentation
dividing the marketplace into parts, which are definable, actionable and profitable, with potential growth. You think of two types of segmentation. You think of
- yielding (pricing segmentation)
segments of rate codes aggregated together into different rate brackets. These customer segments have similar buying behaviors. Some of these behaviors include booking window, or how early one books, the channel or medium through which they purchase their stay, or the purpose of their travels.
- market segmentation
Market segmentation is more associated with how the finance department manages accounting revenue. 

Hotels generally start with four macro level segments. `Transient, group, corporate, and other`. And from there, their segmentation can be customized based on `location and other` characteristics of the property. The distribution has evolved to include `wholesale channels, OTAs, which even have merchant, agency and opaque models within, and retail segments`. 

> Proper segmentation also allows you to make decisions on which customers to take at what point in time. 

If you're nearing a sellout, which customers do you wanna take? Hotels normally segment based on either channel, `price, and booking window.` With loyalty or total lifetime value segmentation hotels actively using a customer relationship management or CRM system to create buckets based on total lifetime value or the per stay spend. Most important is having a segmentation that clearly defines and **separates the customers by channel, price, value, and whatever method the hotel may be using**. The segmentation is critical to forecasting.
### 2. Forecasting and Budgeting

#### Constrained Forecast
used for financial purposes, giving your controller and other team members, a realistic outlook at `how the property is going to fill up`. 
#### Unconstrained Forecast.
used for pricing. If there's a 100% unconstrained demand on one day versus 200% unconstrained to be another day, the price you offer leading up to that day should be vastly different, even though you will end up selling the same number of rooms on both days.

`Compression is when demand outpaces supply` for a given day, at a given hotel. You are considered at higher compression as you reach close to or surpass a sellout. With high compression you should, typically, be yielding your prices up as demand increases, but without understanding demand and without a forecast, you can't know how to properly price your rooms. Hotels, generally, forecast by day, month, and year. 


> if you're able to forecast accurately, you can then price effectively, and optimize your revenues.

Budgeting is, generally, done based on forecasts completed at the end of the previous calendar year. The most common season for budgeting depends on the region, but for most hotel companies it's in **September or October**.

##### The BAR 
by length of stay, as well, has the means of being semi-dynamic. It enables for some ability to `fluctuate the rates` but also still have those `derived rates` based off of one master BAR rate. Bar by length of stay encourages guests to stay longer. Bar by length of stay was the best strategy at a hotel's disposal, until full **open pricing** became an option.
##### Open pricing
Enables each channel and segment to be `independently priced` based on the latent demand for each of those channels and segments. Open pricing provides the opportunity to yield all channels, segments, rates, room types, and promotions independently instead of manipulating prices through static derivatives and restrictions. 
By raising a rate, a hotel is `restricting the number of customers through price rather` than through assumptions from turning off channels or discounts. This ensures that you're getting the right customer for the right price as Robert Cross mentioned, and maximizing your overall revenue. 

> The goal of revenue management is to take the most profitable customer at the right time.

Proper yielding is not just about adjusting prices and distribution, but collectively working with all departments to make sure the hotel is `attracting the right customer at the right time at the right price`

> Remember, the price is the first thing that a customer sees, before any operations or other team members

#### Segmentation
a means to divide the market place and the parts or segments that are definable, accessible, actionable, and profitable and have growth potential. 
There are two major types of segmentation, 
- one for pricing 
- the other for reporting purposes. 

Hotels generally start with four macro level segments, 
- transient,
- corporate,
- group, and
- other
And from there, their segmentation can be customized based on the location and other characteristics of the property. The value of segmenting your market with more flexible and detailed segmentation you could start to isolate specific customer's behaviors, and `consumer pricing patterns so as not to disperse any type of consumer` as long as they are going to be profitable for the property.

##### Online Travel agencies (OTAs)
typically act as a middleman and marketer for a large number of hotels. Examples are;
- Expedia, 
- Priceline, and 
- Booking.com. 

##### Consumer websites 
are those that are distribution partners with a hotel or hotel company reselling or redirecting customers from their business to the hotel. Examples are; 
- TripAdvisor for business, 
- united.com, or 
- uptake. 
##### Retail incorporate channels 
are corporate or travel agents. Example are; 
- American Express business and 
- American Express tap travel agent. 
##### channel management
which acts as an interface between the hotel and its various channels. Example are;
- EZYield, 
- RateTiger, or 
- SiteMinder. 
##### Global distribution systems (GDS)
are systems that enable automated transactions between third parties and booking agents in order to provide travel related services to end consumers. Examples are;
- Galileo, 
- Amadeus, and 
- Sabre.
##### Property management systems (PMSs)
are the systems you see the front desk agents using when you check in at the hotel. It stores intersectional data of the customers at a hotel and is used operationally to manage the hotel.
##### Central reservation system(XRS) 
is a single or centralized distribution system designed to connect to both the GDS and Internet distribution from a single platform. Example of PMSs and CRSs include 
- micros, 
- cenexes, 
- trust and 
- PAR by Springer-Miller. 

#### Strategic Segmentation
The goal of focusing on each segment independently rather than looking at the entire hotel, is that by understanding the consumer behaviors, and segmenting them in appropriate way, a hotel can `maximize property worth revenues and fill the hotel during need periods through appropriate promotions.`

Hotels also need to be sure they have the `right technology systems` in place that can store historical data and historical segmentation, so they can appropriately do analysis of how changes impacted your business.

Some key questions to keep in mind when thinking about segmentation are;
- is it a group or individual coming in?
- are they going to pay for themselves, or are they not paying for themselves
- is there a relevant demand within a certain segment?

> ### Pricing behavior can be a key consumer behavior indicator to help a hotel better segment.

Constantly thinking about `why customers would be coming` to the property will give you a better understanding of `how you should price` to entice them to come to the property. Now, a big question, 
- **is it the chicken or the egg?** 
Does price impact customer behavior or does the buying behavior of the hotel's customer impact price? If you don't outline your price with market or consumer behavior your value perception will be different to market perceptions and you will either have an over or under priced hotel for their proceed value.
- **Analyzing how consumers come to channels**
their spend patterns and trip purpose is a good way of determining this.
- **Evaluate Segmentation**
make sure you evaluate it after and adjust it to ensure you have sufficient profitability Based off these changes. There are three key questions a hotel should ask to determine if they need to re-segment. 
1. Can you tell the mix of business that it has? 
2. if yes, can you tell the booking behavior of each customer segment, ADR, and booking lead time
3. if yes, are you selling out on the day? 

**Segmentation** is the backbone of hotel revenue management. Without it you can't figure out what price to charge a customer. A hotel should be constantly thinking about this throughout the year. Hotels should re-evaluate segmentation `every six months` even if it or the owners are successful.
**Forecasting and budgeting** are the next building block towards having successful revenue management strategy, which we will get into in the next module.

## Forecasting
The term forecasting means `anticipating a certain amount of demand around specific customer segments`, and an aggregate, an entire hotel property. There's two major means of forecasting. One, your unconstrained forecast or those controlled by capacity, and two, your unconstrained forecast or those not controlled by capacity.

### variance
Variance is a comparison of data between time periods. The way you see variance is that you'll have variance compared to same time last year referred to STRY. You'll have variance compared to week over week, and then you'll have variance compared to budget. An example of a variance would be looking at `revenue for June 2014 at a hotel and comparing the revenue with June 2015`. The difference between the two years would be a year over year variance. If there is a large variance understanding what caused that variance is key to being able to adapt a pricing forecast. 
Forecast to budget variance gives you an indication for your forecast to performance with current production on the books versus how you've budgeted and how far ahead or behind your pacing. However, you need to be careful with this metric. Forecasting to budget is all about trying to hit budget numbers, or forecasting your pricing strategy to hit theoretical budget numbers. 

### rolling forecast
A rolling forecast is a live updated forecast completed daily or weekly from changes in between the current and previous forecast. An example of a rolling forecast, would be if, let's say Monday, May 25th, you might have done a 30, 60, 90 day forecast. Then this upcoming Monday, you might do another 30, 60, 90 day forecast based on the pace and pickup changes that occured over a given week. 
### compression
Compression is when demand exceeds supply, and the result is a compressed market. Compression means that prices will likely go up in the market as a whole to curb the increased demand trends. The goal with compression analysis for a hotel is to be able to make appropriate pricing increases leading up to the stay date and to sell out day of.
### forecast a budget
### occupancy
it is the amount of guests staying at a property. Most times occupancy is communicated as a percentage, which is 100% if the property is full.
### forecast accuracy
Within forecast accuracy you hear that you are over or under forecast. Over forecast, means that you forecast too much occupancy or revenue than actually has come in.
### segmentation
### booking window
Booking window is the time period during which `first booking comes` in on a stay date until the night audit of the stay date. Different segments have different booking windows. If you have a longer booking window, you'll need to forecast longer out. Las Vegas for example is a short term market. So most forecasts are 90 days out or less. Meaning there's a heavier emphasis on 30, 60 and 90 day forecasts. In Las Vegas, 90% of bookings come between zero and 90 days before arrival booking window. For resort properties, you'd wanna forecast six months out at weekly intervals because at least 50% of bookings are coming in 90 plus days before arrival. It's really important to be analyzing these early bookings and `create early forecasts and regularly update your long term forecasts`. 
### DBA (days before arrival)
It's a term that is commonly used in the industry and something that is discussed regularly when we're discussing booking windows.
### TBB (To Be Booked or left to sell)
is the number of rooms forecasted left to be sold.
### OTB (On The Books)
means the current number of rooms sold.
### OOO (Out Of Order)
are the number of rooms which are currently out of service at a specific property. 
### A group block 
is when a group calls in to put a hold on a certain number of rooms for a certain date, which the hotel will then section off the inventory. 
### A commit 
means the rooms have been purchased by a customer in the block and are removed or deducted, from the hotel's inventory. 
### Restrictions (closing out a rate)
is when a hotel closes out availability, for a certain rate to a customer. An example of a restriction would be a hotel closing off on Expedia for this upcoming Wednesday.
### Rev par (revenue per available room)
metric commonly used in the industry. It shows the efficiency of the revenue, versus the number of customers who stay at the property.
### ADR (Average Daily Rate()
mean rate charged by the hotel on any given day for any given segment.

Hotel in every market should have **free-floating rates** based on analytics and not directly follow a certain competitor.

### Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
Breaking down your mean absolute deviation into percent.

It is important that a hotel hones in on the validity and accuracy of a forecast to try to be as accurate as possible. Budgeting helps a hotel control costs or run strategies to execute forecasting. Budgeting is very similar to a forecast, but `budgeting is generally completed once a year`, whereas a `forecast can be constantly updated`. A hotel generally budgets performance metrics such as 
- occupancy, 
- revenue, 
- average daily rate, 
- daily, 
- monthly, or 
- quarterly. 

Understanding the implications in each season will better enable you to forecast. Forecasting is the second building block behind segmentation towards developing a price for a hotel. It is the central process for all hotels to do, no matter what the size.

### Pricing strategies 
There were six major ways hotels priced. 
- Single rate, 
- weekday 
- weekend, and 
- seasonal 
approaches introduced in module one. And now I'm going to introduce to you a few new approaches as well. 
- Budget driven, 
- competition based, and 
- length of stay pricing. 

Hotels benchmark their rates using a metric called ADR, or average daily rate. This means that the hotel takes the average of all the room rates paid by the customers.

To monitor a hotel's booking trends, there are really two key terminologies to understand. Pace and pick-up. A hotel's pace is at the rate at which they're getting bookings. And then the hotel's pick-up, is the amount of bookings over a certain time interval. 

### Common pricing mistakes 
1. **Selling out too soon**
The more frequently you change your rates based on supply and demand, the more revenue you can capture. **Dynamic pricing** is one of the key ways to optimize profits and best revenue manage a hotel. It is the most powerful lever a hotel can utilize to control customer booking behavior. As there are many factors and teams who go into deciding a price at a hotel based on the different customer segments, it's important that hotels are empowered with the ability to create `synergy across their operations`, sales and marketing and revenue management departments. 


> # COURSE 3

#### Asset Management Triangle
There are normally three parties involved in the management of a hotel.
1. **an owner or investor**
They will inevitably have vastly different expectations, experience levels, location preferences, budgets, as well as data based on their own research. They will expect `proper management for their investment`, reasonable capital expenditure, or capex, and alignment to their expected return on investment, or ROI, from the team on the ground.
2. **an operator or the management company**
Operators need to be benchmarked against each other and be competitive in their offering. The operator will expect timely payment of fees, working capital and Capex funding to be available, communication between owner through an agreed protocol, and limited interference in the day to day operations, as they are expected to manage the hotel.
3. **the hotel team on the ground.**

If the hotel maximizes its **net operating income (NOI)**, and has a clean balance sheet, the owner will see the increase in the value of the investment, the operator will see the increase in its fee, income and prestige, and the team on the ground will see better bonuses and career prospects.

### Milestones of Hotel Project
- Development and planning
- acquisition and funding
- management format and agreements
- construction and opening
- operational asset management
- with performance and property levels
- and finally the exit.

1. Detailed brief 
From the owner `on what is required, what area, what budget`, etc. Usually the owner has a certain vision or an area in mind. Initial research needs to be done in relation to the; area, population, connectivity, construction restrictions. 
2. feasibility study
3. market and demand analysis.
A market analysis should start broadly at country level with the political and economical outlook and then narrow down to the region or city and town where the project is. It should be detailed with history and forecast, nearest airports, arrivals, leisure and corporate activity. And a clear idea of balance in between business and leisure travelers as well as expected weekday and weekend occupancies. Data is important here as are reliable sources of those data. `One should consider current demand and how it will develop over the next 10 to 15 years.`
4. supply analysis
serious analysis of current supply in hotels and related establishments like guest houses and the short rental market. In particularly in Eastern European countries this is important. It is worthwhile spending money on reliable data here, as current occupancies, average room rates, and the revenue per available room, or rev par, will form the basis of financial projections that need to be done.
5. side project or space appraisal
6. commercial plan or a financial pro forma.
The commercial plan has to take the form of a ten year pro forma of the profit and loss account of the hotel. This needs to be underpinned by realistic revenue and cost assumptions derived from the other three sections and general market knowledge. It needs to be ambitious but not overly aggressive. At this stage we are still talking about fairly general numbers that we'll develop later in the process. Now that you have an estimated project cost, and the year-on-year cash flow, you can work out a high-level return on investment and payback period. 

> **Remember that turnover is vanity and profit is sanity.**

The high level **calculation needs to be updated** quarterly to make sure that, on the one hand, `the project budget is being controlled`, and on the other hand, the market conditions are not materially changing. These factors directly impact ROI, and the owner needs to be aware at all times as he can still adapt to this stage.

#### Technical Service Agreement (TSA)

From an asset management perspective, we have two main areas to focus on.
1. Performance management
which drives the hotel evaluation. 
2. Property management
which runs through the asset cycle. 

**An asset cycle** can be described as the sequence of stages that an asset goes through during its timespan of its ownership. In practical terms, these stages are `launch, growth, maturity, renovation, or exit, and then the relaunch.` 

> The first three years of a hotel can usually be characterized as growth. After which, a hotel will reach its stabilized cruising altitude.

You need to consider renovation and design planning and project management. A cost profit ratio or ROI that has to be created, again, as a full plan comparing the total project cost with the expected increment in annual NOI.

**The real valuation** of a hotel is based on its trading results, in particular the NOI

#### Exit strategy 
The method by which an owner intends to `get out of a hotel investment`, a way of cashing out an investment in the best possible way. The timing of this is crucial. Do you want to sell your company or just the building? This can have a material implication based on local taxation and legislation. 

#### Product Offering
Independent hotels aim to differentiate their experience as part of their product offering. As consumers typically associate their favorite brands with their favorite experiences, hotels have in theory the best resources to implement an experiential approach due to having one of the highest levels of customer interaction whilst the product is being consumed. To avoid the trap of offering more functional features and benefits of the product we must ask ourselves two questions.

1. What types of experiences do we want to provide? Short and long term.
2. How can we integrate these experiences into the product and our branding

#### Segmentation
segments that are viable based on the mass principle of 
- measurability, 
- actionabilty, 
- accessibility and 
- substantiation. 
#### Pricing Strategy
Too many times managers-in-demand believe that the best way to stimulate demand is to change the price. Either directly or via inventory controls. However, the influence of positioning in combination with guest satisfaction, means that hotels can make the same profit from either dropping rate or spending more.

##### Pricing per segment
**Best Available Rate (BAR)
which can be defined as the `lowest non-restricted rate bookable by all guests`. This rate is available to all customers. However, the hotel will likely change the rate frequently depending on market demand. The BAR is usually considered the rate and transient segment upon which all other rate plans are calculated, often known as the prevailing rate. Hotels typically construct **multiple levels of BAR rate, depending on demand**, with interdependency to different room types, typically referred to as the room supplement.

**Negotiated Rate** 
Restricted, or qualified rate, that has been set through an `agreement between the provider and an entity such as a corporation or government`. Negotiated rates apply to specifically defined groups or categories of traveller for a specific time period, after which, the rate no longer applies and must be renegotiated. 

**Tour Operator Rate** 
Follows the same principles as the negotiated rate. However, it will apply a `deeper discount in return for specific volume commitments and/or additional marketing`. Operators are traditionally focused on the leisure traveller, however, they support their entire experience and needs, typically a flight.

> The use of length of stay and seasonal pricing is important.

###### Direct to property 
Refers to all customers that establish a direct relationship with the hotel by a hotel controlled channels. And they're deemed as being `more loyal than other segments.` Like the OTA component in this sort of leisure, direct or proxy guests will typically book transient rates. Such as the hotel's best available rate, packages and promotions. And as such, are likely to be more engaged with the hotel and interact both before and after their stay.

As we can see in this slide, hotels can expect to work with new metrics such as net **RevPAR** which is the `net room revenue per available room`. This is calculated as 
(room revenue - the cost of distribution) / divided by the total rooms available for sale.
As a reminder from the previous screens, the cost of distribution refers specifically to those associated directly with the delivery of the reservation, commission and transaction fees. Whereas, the cost of acquisition then includes the wider marketing and labor costs per channel.
What makes marketing a hotel unique from marketing other services and products is that the guests must be willing to give up their personal security in staying somewhere that is not their usual home. **When you market a hotel, you are marketing trust.**

### What makes a hotel standout.
Figure out a clear **Unique Selling proposition(USP)** for the hotel. To determine the usp you have to consider the 
- location 
- price
- comfort

#### Capturing Visitors
A survey of guests that have booked on hotel websites revealed that the top three sources of bookings for hotel websites were **friends and family** at 23%, Trip Advisor at 22% and OTAs at 16%.

##### The power of OTAs 
To be visible in front of all travellers. Realise that the vast majority of hotel website visitors would already have heard about the hotel, even before going to the website. And that a website alone will not be enough to popularize your hotel. So, if you correctly listed your hotel `on every possible list and booking platform for your destination`, there is a high chance that travellers will be searching for your hotel to find out more.
##### Hotel's website 
Capturing those visitors, it is a fact that when a user is typing the exact name of a hotel, or product for that matter, in a search engine, they are very close to the end of the booking journey. To complete the journey, the traveler still needs to convert the website visit into a reservation and then share their experience which will generate future guests.

Approximately 95% of the people on a hotel's website have three questions.
1. Where is the hotel, 
2. how are the rooms, and 
3. what is the price?. 

The four main parts you need to to manage a hotelsbrand.com marketing. They are, 
- popularizing, 
- capturing, 
- converting, and 
- sharing.

**Focus on the content**, spending extra time checking the content, re-reading it, working it to read well is your main job here. Put yourself in the shoes of a travel agent or a corporate travel agent and read the contents you have uploaded. 
- Is it interesting?
- Do you wanna read it?
- Would you book that hotel?
- Have you added every picture possible on the platforms that accept pictures?

#### Channel Optimization
If you can determine how many hours are spent per channel, per day, week, month. You would have a much more accurate measure, so it is recommended to do that. The result of such an exercise will determine the `cost per reservation`. Which you can use to determine the net revenue of your reservations. And if you do this accurately, you might be surprised to discover which channel is expensive, and which isn't. With this data, you then can determine how much you're willing to spend to increase the marketing and sales through other channels. **Look at your profit and loss statement honestly**. Take a look at those items and be honest in your conversion attribution if you are a little bit more sophisticated than the subject. Be honest on what channel gets you the most for the money you spend on it.

### Recurrent Problems
#### #1
**No matter what price you charge it's probably the wrong one** The problem is no matter what price you charge, it is probably the wrong price, at least for the majority of people. So it is not about finding the perfect price. But instead, `finding the price and volume relationship that will bring you the most revenue`. This is usually not the highest or the lowest price, but it also depends on how many rooms you need to sell. 

#### #2
Finally, the last main problem that revenue management helps hotels overcome, is the issue that whenever your hotel's going to be full, `someone will cancel`.
