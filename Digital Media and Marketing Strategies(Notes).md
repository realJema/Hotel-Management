#### Market research strategies  
Marketers rely on a number of data sources and research methods to gather information about consumer and audience behavior. These methods can be organized in several categories. 
1) **Formal** 
formal research requires dedicated resources and expertise. Large companies often rely on specialized research firms or external consultants to conduct systematic and thorough studies to address specific questions.
2) **Informal**
informal research involves collecting market intelligence by using a variety of easily available information from various sources. For example, marketers can get a quick sense of a brand's status by keeping track of its media coverage. There are a lot of advantages in conducting informal research, such as cost effectiveness and quick results. However, informal research typically lacks the statistical in-sampling precision required for making important strategic decisions. 
3) **Primary data sources** 
Consumer and audience research can rely on primary data collected by researchers for specific purposes. Primary research on the other hand, involves first party data collection. Typically, these studies are `designed to address specific questions related to product design and marketing decisions`. Companies can either pay research firms and academic institutions to conduct this research, or they can lead the effort in house. Focus groups, surveys, polls, content analysis, A/B testing, and ethnography are just some of the better-known methods for primary research data collection. Primary research is useful in answering specific questions unique to a marketing goal. For example, you can gain insight on how users like or dislike certain features of your product. However, collecting and maintaining primary data can be costly, it also requires a high level of expertise and dedicated resources.
4) **Secondary data sources**
utilizing existing secondary datasets that might be available to the company. A firm can analyze secondary datasets maintained by government agencies or public institutions. For example, social demographic data, economic indicators, financial trends, and etc. There are also many commercially available databases that a business can access at a cost. Data collected and kept by secondary research sources are useful in understanding broad market trends, they often also provide a historical perspective by tracking the same set of indicators over time.

let's look at the specific processes you can use to **identify and study your target consumer**. Gather as much data and information about the thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors of this target consumer group. Traditional market research, such as surveys and focus groups, can provide valuable insights to create an initial profile of your target consumers; 
- what do they like or dislike? 
- Where do they go for leisure and entertainment? 
- What kinds of TV shows and radio programs are they likely to watch or listen? 
- How often and where do they go shopping? 

Through `analyzing web traffic and cookie data`, a company can identify events that would lead to consumers making an online purchase of a product, like viewing a particular news website and then reading a particular article during a particular time. A deep understanding of your target consumers behavior patterns is important. Through both conventional and new research tools, marketers today have the ability to paint an extremely detailed and accurate portrait of their targets.

## Know Your Goal
Before you plan for any campaigns, it is essential to make sure that your communication strategies are aligned with your overall marketing goals and your `marketing goals are aligned with your business objectives`.

Digital media users are active, Consumers today are exposed to a huge amount of information every day, besides mass advertising and marketing promotions. The newer generations of consumers can get information about products, services, and brands through many other channels beyond the control of marketers. For example, when I purchased my last car, I gathered information about many different types of cars, considered their utilities and functions and went through a ton of reviews and independent reports. I decided on the brand, the model, the color, and even the price point before I contacted a local dealer to buy a specific car in their inventory. 

#### Effective digital strategy 
Offer consumers `a pleasant, seamless, and informative experience` on their journeys, digital marketers must select the right communication strategy for the right consumer at the right moment. While paid advertising can be used to reach and engage consumers in any stage of the journey, specific advertising messages should be tailored to different consumers for different goals on different platforms.

This simple, **personalized acknowledgement and the gentle approach** to offering their service made such an impact on my evaluation of that dealer.The digital revolution has brought new opportunities for marketers to consider the needs of individual consumers and create a tailored communication strategy for that individual. Digital marketers should consider the `key characteristics and affordances of different digital channels` and use them appropriately to create different funnels for different types of consumers.

##### What do you hope to achieve? 
Should no longer be considered in the context of a one to many mass communication, but instead should be a question we ask in the interpersonal contexts. This will allow them to be more strategic and effective.

**Earned media** is content that is organically generated by other users and online publishers such as product reviews, social media following and sharing, and coverage by online news outlets.
